# Application of CBSDG 

This repository contains the first real data application of Cluster-Based Synthetic Data Generation (CBSDG). The included code was used to perform the analysis in the manuscript titled "Evaluating cluster-based synthetic data generation for blood transfusion analysis". We reproduce an analysis by Vinkenoog et al. (2022) with synthetic data and compare original and synthetic data results as a measure of utility. In addition, attribute disclosure risk is identified for both the original and synthetic data. To reproduce the analyses we use the original code by Vinkenoog et al. (2022) (https://zenodo.org/records/6938113) and the donor data used for the original article. These data are not included in the repository to preserve privacy of the donors. The code can be used to analyze the settings chosen to generate synthetic data and view the experiment set-up.
